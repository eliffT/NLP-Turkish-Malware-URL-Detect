# ***CLASSIFYING URL ADRESSES WITH THE BERT MODEL*** #

*This project encompasses the development of an artificial intelligence model using natural language processing technology to detect malicious URL addresses. The project is built upon Hugging Face's transformers library, utilizing the pre-trained BERT model.*


## Project Objectives ##

* *Utilizing natural language processing techniques to detect malicious URL addresses.*
* *Developing the most optimal artificial intelligence model by adjusting hyperparameters and training steps.*
* *Sharing the developed model on the Hugging Face platform for accessibility.*
 </br></br>

## ***Utilized Datasets*** ##

1. ***Kaggle Balanced_URL Dataset:** This dataset comprises a balanced collection of URL data containing both malicious and benign addresses. It was obtained from the Kaggle platform.*

2. ***USOM Malicious URL Dataset:** This dataset, provided by the Turkey Cyber Incident Response Center (USOM), contains malicious URL addresses.*
</br>

*These two datasets were merged to be used in training the model.*
